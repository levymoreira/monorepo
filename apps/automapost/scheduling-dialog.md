You are working as a senior software engineer and ux designer for automapost.com. 
We are creating a platform that allows you to create and schedule posts across social media platforms.

Your task is to create a new page for the platform.
This is the most important page for the platform.
We will create the page where the user can create/schedule new posts.

The requirements are:
- The page should be responsive and mobile friendly.
- The user should be able to edit the post manually or talk to the chat bot to generate the post.
- The user should be able to talk to the chat bot and the bot should ask confirmation using actions (buttons in the chat), like "Yes", "No", "Edit", "Generate", "Apply changes".
- The user should be able to edit the post manually and define the time/day it will be posted. 
- The user must be able to attach images to the post. 
- The post editor should be as similar as possible to linkeding post.

Specific details:
- The page should be a modal but full screen. 
- To fit on mobile, we will be breaking the page into 2 tabs on mobile (the "Chat" bot tab and the "Post" content tab) for desktop there will be no tabs, all can be shown on the same page. 
- The header must have: a back button on the top left, and the title "New Post" on the right of the back button. On mobile we hide the new post title to give space for the tabs; On mobile instead of the title we will show the tabs called "Chat" and the other one "Post".
- On desktop we must have a line in the middle of the page to separate the chat (left) and the post content (right). What is on the left is the what will be seen on the "Chat" tab and what is on the right is the what will be seen on the "Post" tab.
- On the left of the page we must have a chat on the style of chat gpt/gemini/claude. The initial state will always be a message from "AutomaPost" with some ideas to the user to choose from and start brainstorming. Of course we must have the input field for the user to write his message to the chat bot and the button to send the message.
- On the right of the page we must have the post editor. It should have the same style as linkedin post editor, the date should be pre-defined with the name " - Edit" all in one link  so the user can click to change the date. The post should have the user image and name on the top link on linkedin post ,and the engagement under it. 
Below that we must have the option to add images to the post.
- At the bottom right of the page we must have the buttons to Safe Draft or Schedule in this order being "Safe Draft" a tirdiary/gost button and "Schedule" a primary button.
