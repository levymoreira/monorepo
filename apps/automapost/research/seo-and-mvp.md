1. AI
2. Google, Youtube, Tiktok search
3. ahrefs 
Plug in our list and get hard data: search volume, keyword difficulty (KD—aim for <30 for easy ranking), CPC (higher means paying users exist), and traffic potential
Competitors Enter urls like buffer.com or later.com, check their organic keywords, and see sources (SEO vs. ads). Look for organic growth signals (e.g., if a term drives traffic without paid spend, it's gold for us).
Filters: Focus on terms with 100+ monthly searches, low KD, and relevance to our MVP (e.g., platform-specific like "linkedin post scheduler" if we start there).
Pro Tip: Since Ahrefs shows "parent topics," we can cluster terms (e.g., group "ai post generator" with variations) for content ideas. Head to ahrefs.com for the tool—sign up if we haven't (free trial might cover us).
5. Launch Test: Once we have ranked terms, create a landing page on Vercel optimized for the top 3-5 (e.g., automapost.com/ai-instagram-scheduler). Run Google/Meta ads on them ASAP to test conversions, then layer SEO. Automate outreach with tools like storyshort.ai for content around these terms.
